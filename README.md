# MaxTouch Debug

This is a work in progress tool for tuning MaxTouch sensors in QMK based trackpads (currently Peacock and Ploopy Pavonis). If you build a firmware with the debug keymap this tool can visualize the raw sensor data, and in the future will enable you to change register values and inspect the results.
